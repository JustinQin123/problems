# Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `candies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number
of candies in the i-th pile, and a positive integer `k` representing the number
of children.

You want to distribute candies to the children such that:

- Each child receives candies from **only one pile**
- Each child receives the **same number of candies**
- A pile can be split into multiple parts
- Some piles may be unused

Return the **maximum number of candies** each child can receive.

If it is not possible to distribute candies to all `k` children, return `0`.

## Constraints

- 1 <= candies.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= candies[i] <= 10^7
- 1 <= k <= 10^12

## Example 1

Input:
candies = [5, 8, 6]
k = 3

Output:
5

Explanation:
It is possible to give each child 5 candies.

## Example 2

Input:
candies = [2, 5]
k = 11

Output:
0

Explanation:
There are not enough candies to give all children at least 1 candy.

## Instructions

- Please implement your solution in Java (preferred).
- Be prepared to explain your approach and time complexity.
