# Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `limit`.

A subarray is considered valid if the absolute difference between the
maximum value and the minimum value in the subarray is **less than or equal to** `limit`.

Return the length of the **longest** valid continuous subarray.


## Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- 0 <= limit <= 10^9

## Example 1

Input:
nums = [8, 2, 4, 7]
limit = 4

Output:
2

Explanation:
The subarray [2, 4] has a maximum difference of 2, which is within the limit.

## Example 2

Input:
nums = [10, 1, 2, 4, 7, 2]
limit = 5

Output:
4

Explanation:
The subarray [2, 4, 7, 2] has a maximum value of 7 and a minimum value of 2,
so the difference is 5, which is within the limit.

## Example 3

Input:
nums = [4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2]
limit = 0

Output:
3

Explanation:
The longest valid subarray consists of equal values, since the limit is 0.

## Instructions

- Please implement your solution in Java (preferred).
- Be prepared to explain your reasoning and time/space complexity.
