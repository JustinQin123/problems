# Backspace String Compare

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t` which include lowercase letters and the character `#` representing a backspace, determine if the two strings are equal after processing all backspaces. A `#` deletes the character immediately before it (if any). Return `true` if the final processed strings are identical, otherwise return `false`.

## Examples

Example 1
Input:
s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output:
true
Explanation:
Both strings become "ac" after processing backspaces.

Example 2
Input:
s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output:
true
Explanation:
Both strings become "" after processing backspaces.

Example 3
Input:
s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output:
false
Explanation:
s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".

## Constraints

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase letters and the character `#`.

## Instructions

- Please implement a solution that returns whether the processed strings are equal.
- You may use any language; Java is preferred if you want consistency with other problems.

public class Solution {

    public boolean backspaceCompare(String s, String t) {

    }

}
